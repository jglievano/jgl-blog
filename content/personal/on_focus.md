It seems everyone is so focused. But the don't have a vision. They wake up
every day and the list of things to do is so staggering that they don't know
where to start. They try to-do lists and [pomodoro] techniques to get the stuff
done but they still fail. However, the motivation behind it is cloudy and still
a mystery to me. When I ask them they don't really have answers to questions
such as why do they do it? what is the end goal? what is next? how do you
see yourself in the long term? Is like they do all this _"living in the
moment"_, _going with the flow_. Why question the things you can do?

You're a work and a manager tells you what to work on. Depending on how big
your company is, there will be a number of managers on top of the one deciding
what the direction is. You basically join a company so others can dictate what
your life's work should be about. _Life/work_ balance is not what media defines
it to be. Is not about how much time you spend with your family, your hobbies
or your gym. Is about how much of what you do at work has meaning to you. After
all, we're spending _at least_ one half of our waking life at work. And taking
more time outside work doesn't really help the economy, does it? For
successful growing companies, unlike successful idle ones, their common
denominator seems to be hard work. Not too much free food, working from home or
free gym memberships. It's about how much of what you do is aligned to your
life's dream and pursuits. "I want to make a difference in health", and so you
go in the health industry. "I want to make a difference in virtual reality",
and so you go to work on companies pushing the limits of virtual reality. If
you work 20 hours a day on things you're passionate about then who cares about
the to-do lists? Still, we don't usually join these organizations with aligned
vision and missions. Often we don't even have a vision or a mission. Most times
we're mercenaries playing the social status games. Not too different from being
a _World of Warcraft_ addict.
